# MIT-6.824-NOTE
This is my learning notes and progress of MIT 6.824 from https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/. I will finish the lectures, readings, programming labs and all of this course in 2022.

I won't publish the code into Github as this courese requires in the Collaboration policy from the [website](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/general.html).
```java
Collaboration policy
You must write all the code you hand in for the programming assignments, except for code that we give you as part of the assignment. You are not allowed to look at anyone else's solution. You may discuss the assignments with other students, but you may not look at or use each other's code.

Please do not publish your code or make it available to current or future 6.824 students. github.com repositories are public by default, so please don't put your code there unless you make the repository private. You may find it convenient to use MIT's GitHub, but be sure to create a private repository.

You may discuss the paper questions with other students, but you may not look at other students' answers. You must write your answers yourself.
